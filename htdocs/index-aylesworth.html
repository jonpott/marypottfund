             <h2>About the Series</h2>
	     <p>The Mary Pott Visiting Writer Series is a program supported by the Mary Pott Elementary Education Fund.  The Fund has supported several programs for the Hamilton district's elementary schools, donating dozens of books to their libraries and encouraging children in the district's summer school programs to become more involved in reading.</p>
             <p>Now, Mary's desire to encourage children to read has led her family to establish the Visiting Writer Series as a way for children to be inspired by meeting authors of books they know and enjoy.  The Visiting Writer Series will be an ongoing program sponsored by the Fund, and will help bring more well-known authors to visit the schools.</p>

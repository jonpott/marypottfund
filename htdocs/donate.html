Please consider making a donation, so that the Fund can continue expanding and helping more students for years to come.</p>

	     <p>Mary Pott Education Fund<br>
	     c/o Allegan County Community Foundation<br>
	     524 Marshall Street<br>
	     Allegan MI 49010</p>

	     <p><i>* Make sure to note "Mary Pott Fund" on  your check, and please specify the Endowed or Non-Endowed fund (see below).</i></p>
	     <p>&nbsp;</p>


	     <h2>Endowed or Non-Endowed?</h2>	     
	     <p>Here's what you should know about the two types of donations you can make:</p>
	     <p>&nbsp;</p>

	     <h3>The Endowed Fund</h3>
	     <p>Donations to the Endowed Fund will support the Fund long-term, providing an ongoing stream of funding to support the Fund's objectives.  We cannot use the money in the Endowed Fund directly; we have access to a percentage of the Fund's total value year after year.  This protects the endowment from being used up, helping guarantee that it will continue to be available for many years.  Donations made to the Endowed Fund are eligible for both the Michigan tax credit, as well as a tax deduction.</p>
	     <p>&nbsp;</p>

	     <h3>The Non-Endowed Fund</h3>
	     <p>Donations to the Non-Endowed Fund can be used for special projects or immediate needs because the total value of the fund is available for our use at any time.  Donations given to the Non-Endowed Fund are ONLY eligible for a tax deduction.</p>
	     <p>&nbsp;</p>

	     <h3>Which One?</h3>
	     <p>The choice is yours, though right now we would like to work on building up the <b>Non-Endowed Fund</b> so that we can plan some initiatives for the next few years, in addition to the continued funding of the Visiting Writer Series.  But your gift is welcome, no matter how you choose to give!</p>

        <h1>About Mary</h1>

        <p>Mary Pott taught for more than three decades at Hamilton Elementary School, and she touched the lives of hundreds of people during her time there. Mary's family established the Fund in her memory, after her sudden death in February 2002, with the hundreds of donations given by her friends, family, colleagues, former students, and many others.</p>

        <h2>About The Fund</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to provide assistance to students in the elementary schools of the Hamilton, Michigan school district, particularly in the areas of reading and the arts.  The Mary Pott Elementary Education Fund is directed by Mary's family, and its assets are managed by the Allegan County Community Foundation. The ACCF has been instrumental in the fund's success and growth. </p>

        <p>While the Fund has a strong base, continuing and expanding its work requires financial support.  Please consider <a href="donate.html">making a donation</a>, so that we can continue expanding and helping more students for years to come.</p>
